# flask_new
in product_service:
the name is misleading because app.py has two user related methods: get and delete
there's requirements.txt, test and dockerfile related to it
!! ignore db.py, it does nothing

in user_service:
app.py has two user related methods: post and put
there's requirements.txt, test and dockerfile

outside there db_config.env (self explanatory), docker-compose and init_db.sql which has the schema of the table
